Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Pathway WP2586	Jan-46	0.03173298	0.07431076	0	0	34.08717949	117.6143623	EP300	"The leading cause of lung cancer is exposure to cigarette smoke and other environmental pollutants, which include formaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, dioxin, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs and dioxins are exogenous ligands that directly bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that activates xenobiotic metabolism, histone modification (an important step in DNA methylation), and, ultimately, tumorigenesis"	Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor and Lung Cancer

It is an urgent need to fully understand the pathogenesis of lung cancer and provide new ideas for its treatment. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has identified that transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and tRNA metabolism–associated enzymes not only participate in the protein translation but also play an important role in the occurrence and development of lung cancer"	tRNA Metabolism and Lung Cancer: Beyond Translation
